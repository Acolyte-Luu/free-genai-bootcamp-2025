## ChatGPT Powered Assistant Guide

### Model

GPT-4-turbo. Currently using this model because I amm on the free lan of ChatGPT. I also do not want to spend my use of the o1 reasoning model.

### Prompting Guide

For the ChatGPT model i was using, it seemed like it took the instrutions better if it was in a markdown format instead of a plain text file. That is why, i am using a markdown for this assistant. Also borrowed most of Andrew's prompting instructions which worked well.

Used ChatGPT to help with formatting the XML for use in the markdown since all my instructions and examples are contained in a single file.
