For the Anthropic Claude model as well, it seemed like it took the instrutions better if it was in a markdown format instead of a plain text file. That is why, i am using a markdown for this assistant. Also borrowed most of Andrew's prompting instructions which worked well.

Used ChatGPT to help with formatting the XML for use in the markdown since all my instructions and examples are contained in a single file.
