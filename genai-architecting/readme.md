## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning infrastructure.
The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI.

They want to invest an AI PC where they can afford a spend of 10k.
They have 100 active students, and students are located within the city of Accra.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10K.


We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 100 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We're considering using IBM Granite because it is a truly open-source model with training data that is traceable, so we can avoid any copyright issues
